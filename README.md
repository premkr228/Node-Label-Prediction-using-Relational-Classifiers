# Node-Label-Prediction-using-Relational-Classifiers
This project uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) via PyTorch Geometric for node label prediction. Using the OGBN-Products dataset (Amazon co-purchase network), we apply message-passing to learn node representations from features and structure. The goal is to classify nodes into specific product categories accurately.
